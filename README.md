# Codename: Strain

I developed this game as my final project for my Bachelor's in Software Engineering. It was done in 2012 and I haven't picked it up since then... maybe I should change that!

Here's a [short video demo](http://youtu.be/l3j3YySmCuE) that I used in my presentation (it's meant to go with someone talking over it and explaining... maybe I should add a voiceover later)

This repository holds both the sourcecode for the Server (in .net) and Android Client.

**Note 1: Not sure if this is working properly on Android anymore.**
